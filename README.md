A Google Assistant, but on Slack. It allows you to search Google, fetch the date, look up GIFs, and more. More features are in the works.

### Requirements:

 - Node.JS (preferably v6.0.0+)
 - Botkit
 - Request
 - Google Search Scraper
 - Oxford Dictionary API

### Installation:

`npm install`

### Getting Started:
#### Running Locally as a Custom Integration
 - Create a new custom integration in your Slack workspace
   https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1
 - Under the Add Features and Functionality section add a new bot
 - Give the bot a Display name and Default User name and complete by adding the new bot user
 - Under the Settings section, select Install App and install your new add to your workspace
 - After installation, the OAuth Tokens for Your Team is displayed.  Copy the bot user auth token (xoxb -)

 - Update the config.js file providing the bot user auth token
 - Start the Bot running locally via node
   `node bot.js`
 - Console output for running bot
  ```
  Initializing Botkit v0.6.3
  info: ** No persistent storage method specified! Data may be lost when process shuts down.
  info: ** API CALL: https://slack.com/api/rtm.connect
  notice: ** BOT ID: botname ...attempting to connect to RTM!
  notice: RTM websocket opened
 ```
 - Once running got to your Slack workspace, and click on your Bot under the Apps section
 - Say 'Hello' to the Bot and if configured correctly you should get the response 'Hey there! How can I help you?'

#### Other Services and APIs
  - You should register for an API KEY or access to the apis running the other services in order to make use of those commands
  - Update the config.js with your keys and information as necessary

### Known Issues:

 - Google Search Scraper gives 10 results instead of the results specified (fixed by modifying directly the module)
 - Captcha (make a VPN for the bot, connect via VPN, fill out captcha for latest search, try again)
 - Translation returns BAD_NETWORK or something like that (fixed by modifying directly the module)
